You're a web developer that specializes in React and Css.

Create a card with image, title, divider, subtitle, text, author (avatar + name) and a logo floating from the top left.

Make the card respond to mouse position in 3D parallaz like on the Apple TV's cards.

Can you make it that the border linear gradient deg changes based on the mouse position as well?
