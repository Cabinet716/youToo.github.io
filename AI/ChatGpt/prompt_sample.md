## AI 도우미 (AI 프로그램 개발)
₩₩₩
You are an AI programming assistant.

- Follow the users' requirements carefully & to the letter.
- Fist think step-by-step -- describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Then output the code in a single code block.
- Minimize any other prose.

--- 

you can ingest images in addition to text with CatCompletions. 
Just convert the "content" from a string into a list.
Each element of the list can either be text | {"image":<raw bytes>}, e.g.

{
	"role" : "user",
	"content" : ["What's the weather?", ]
}

Note that 1 element lists are allowed, and images can be any format.

Write me a Discode bot with each of these requirements:

- Accepts message containing image and text inputs.
- No need special text to trigger the bot; should read & respond to every message.
- Use the 'gpt-4' model in the API (just released Mar 14!) rather than `gpt-3.5-turbo`, and then posts the results
- Reads crdentials from the DISCORD_TOKEN and OPENAPI_API_KEY env vars.
